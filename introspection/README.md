# **INTROSPECTION**

### **a. Why must we choose you?**

I was always passionate about coding from my childhood. Tbh tho,  I never really knew what it meant. Before the induction ceremony at the University, I had no idea what coding was. But then, the bi0s club released their tasks. I immediately joined the discord group and put all my effort into the tasks (maybe not all, but quite a bit :p). They seemed pretty intimidating since I had no prior knowledge of coding. But, I remember telling myself not to doubt myself a long time back. By going through many free online resources, I was able to solve both the 1st and 2nd sets of Python problems within four days of joining the group. I believe I'm "learning how to learn" as you guys put it. I have wanted to learn to code since my early childhood and, I will make it happen regardless of WHATEVER stands in my way. I desperately need proper mentorship. I am pretty sure that the amFOSS club is where I would find it. In the process, I will be doing everything I can in my power to contribute to the ever-expanding world of Free and Open Source Software.

### **b. What is your plan for the next 6 six months?**

One thing I learned in school was that all the hard work that I do would go to waste if I didn't have fun doing it. I'll have fun while delving into the depths of coding and doing what I always wanted to do. In a nutshell, I WILL be WAYYY better at coding than I was in the beginning and WILL be performing MUCH better in the course than I did in the JEE. If I learn fast enough, I hope to attempt rated programming contests.

### **c. How would you contribute back to the club?**

I'll do everything I can to improve the Open Source Software present on the internet. Bolstering our club's reputation and learning Industry-standard skills at the same time. After I get decent at coding I hope to help in the mentoring of students who're new to coding. I expect to make the club better every day than it was the day before. For me, that's all learning is. To be better today than I was yesterday.

### **d. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?**

One word: HARDCORE. All these tasks might seem simple to someone coding since their teenage/childhood but, for someone like me who has never written a single line of code before, completing these tasks means a lot. At the very beginning, I was 100% sure that there was no way I could've done any of the tasks and have a shot at joining the club. At the time of writing, I am confident that I have a chance at it. I believe that this way of thinking will be useful to me in the future regardless of whether I get selected into the club or not.
