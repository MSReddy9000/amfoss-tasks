# **INTROSPECTION**

### **a. Why must we choose you?**

*I was always passionate about coding from my childhood but, I never really knew what it meant. In fact, before the induction ceremony started at the campus I had no idea what coding was. But then, the bi0s club released their tasks. I immediately joined the discord group and put my heart and soul to solve the tasks. It seemed intimidating at first as I had no prior experience in Python. But, the fire to learn to code burnt hard in me. By going through innumerable online sources and multiple YouTube videos I was able to solve both the 1st and 2nd sets of Python problems within 5 days of joining the group. I believe I'm "learning how to learn" as you guys put it. I have a raging fire inside me to learn to code and I will accomplish my goal no matter what. I desperately need proper mentorship and I am pretty sure amFOSS is where I would find it. In the process, I will be doing everything I can in my power to contribute to the ever expanding world of Free and Open Source Software.*

### **b. What is your plan for the 6 six months?**

*One thing I learnt in school was that all hard work that I do would go to waste if I didn't have fun doing it. I believe I'll have fun while delving into the depths of coding and doing my best to perform well at the Semester. In a nutshell, I hope to be MUCH MUCH MUCH better at coding than in the 1st month and hope to perform MUCH MUCH MUCH better in the Semester than I did in the JEE.*

### **c. How would you contribute back to the club?**

*I'll contribute a lot to the FOSS projects on the internet thus, increasing our club's reputation and after I get decent at programming I'll help in the mentoring of people who're new to coding. I expect to make the club better every day than it was the day before. Isn't that what life is about? Being a better person than you were yesterday?*

### **d. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?**

*One word: MAGNIFICENT. I like to be thrown into the thick of things without knowing what's actually happening, this forces me to think smarter and harder. I believe that's going to be my driving force to learn in the upcoming days.*
