# **INTROSPECTION**

### **a. Why must we choose you?**

I was always passionate about coding from my childhood but, I never really knew what it meant. In fact, before the induction ceremony started at the campus I had no idea what coding was. But then, the bi0s club released their tasks. I immediately joined the discord group and put my heart and soul to solve the tasks. It seemed intimidating at first as I had no prior experience in Python. But, the fire to learn to code burnt hard in me. By going through innumerable online sources and multiple YouTube videos I was able to solve both the 1st and 2nd sets of Python problems within 5 days of joining the group. I believe I'm "learning how to learn" as you guys put it. I wanted to learn to code since my early childhood and I will make it happen regardless of whatever stands in my way. Though, I desperately need proper mentorship and I am pretty sure that the amFOSS club is where I would find it. In the process, I will be doing everything I can in my power to contribute to the ever expanding world of Free and Open Source Software.

### **b. What is your plan for the 6 six months?**

One thing I learnt in school was that all hard work that I do would go to waste if I didn't have fun doing it. I'll have fun while delving into the depths of coding and doing my best to perform well at the Semester. In a nutshell, I hope to be MUCH MUCH MUCH better at coding than I was in the 1st month and hope to perform MUCH MUCH MUCH better in the course than I did in the JEE. If I learn fast enough, I hope to attempt rated programming contests.

### **c. How would you contribute back to the club?**

I'll do everything I can to improve the Open Source Software present on the internet thus, bolstering our club's reputation and learning Industry standard skills at the same time. After I get decent at programming I hope to help in the mentoring of students who're new to coding. I expect to make the club better every day than it was the day before. Isn't that what learning is about? Being better at something than you were yesterday?

### **d. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?**

One word: HARDCORE. All these tasks might seem fairly simple to someone who's been actually coding since their teenage/childhood but, for someone like me who never wrote a single line of code before, completing tasks like these mean a lot. Especially since I'm competing with people who've been coding for a pretty long time. At the very beginning, I was 100% sure that there was no way I could complete any of the tasks and get selected into the club. At the time of writing, I am confident that I have a fair shot for joining. I believe that this way of thinking will be useful to me in the near future regardless of whether I get selected into the club or not.
