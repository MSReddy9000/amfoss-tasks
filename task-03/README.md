# **3. Programming**
*My hackerrank username is "ashishreddy9000" without the quotation marks. All the solutions I came up with will be uploaded to this folder :)*
#### **NOTE: Some of these problems were attempted in the very beginning, some of them in the middle and some of them in the very end of the time given for submitting this repo so, I have LOTS of submissions for a few problems. Like DOZENS of submissions. I hope you guys will excuse me for so many submissions. I will give a brief explanation of the FINAL algorithm that I arrived to for each problem here**
#### **NOTE: Tasks were submitted in both Python 3 and PyPy3.**
## **1. Great Eye --> GreatEye.py**
### **Final Submission Interpreter/Compiler**
PyPy3 compiler
### **Algorithm Used**
1. I checked whether a kth word existed or not. If not, it would print "-1" straight away
2. I located the kth word using the initial list I took the input into
3. I wrote a loop to iterate through the word and add all it's ascii values.
### **Points obtained**
100/100
## **2. Good strings. --> Goodstrings..py**
### **Final Submission interpreter/compiler**
Python 3 Interpreter
### **Algorithm Used**
1. This algorithm was rather simple, A string is bad if it has equal no. of 0's and 1's. Otheriwse, it's ALWAYS a good string. Those are the only 2 possible cases. So, if a string is bad, it needs to be divided into 2 parts and that's about it!
2. I iterated through the string and appended all 1's to one list and 0's to another list.
3. I finally compared their lengths to check if they're equal or not and then, printed 1 or 2 acc. to it
### **Points Obtained**
100/100
