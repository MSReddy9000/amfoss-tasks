# **Project Euler #4: Largest palindrome product**
## **Method of Approach**
*This task was pretty easy aswell. I generated the list of all 3 digit numbers. And then, I generated a huge list of all the palindromes below the given number for the largest input number (This was to make sure that the palindrome list wouldn't be generated again and again for each test case). I took the required numbers from the large palindrome list for smaller test cases and stored them into a buffer list for performing operations. Then, I reversed the palindrome list as I had to find the largest number (iterating from the end would make the code faster). Then I checked if the palindrome was divisible by any 3-digit number. If it was, I divided the palindrome by that 3 digit number to find the other divisor. If it was 3-digit as well, I appended it to a list (I later realized that I could've broken the loop instead of appending the palindromes to the answer buffer even after finding the largest palindrome number).Then, I took the max number of the answer buffer and printed it out.*
