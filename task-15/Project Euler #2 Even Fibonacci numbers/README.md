# **Project Euler #2 Even Fibonacci numbers.py**
## **Method of Approach**
*This task was the easiest of all the 5 tasks, I coded it within a few minutes when compared to an hour or so for tasks 3, 4 and 5. When completing the tasks given by the bi0s club, I had to deal with a somewhat similar problem involving the generation of tribonnaci numbers. I used a simple logic there and implemented the exact same here. First I would start with a simple fibonacci list of 1 and 2. I would also start with a "buffer" list containing the same 1 and 2. Then, I would add up the two elements in the buffer list, store them in a "temp" variable and append the value to both the buffer list and the fibonnaci list. After that, I would pop the first element in the buffer list so after a single iteration the buffer had 2 and 3. I looped it to generate as many fibonnaci numbers as required. Then, I used a simple for loop to determine if the fibonnaci number is even or not. If it was even, add it to sum. In the end, print sum.*
