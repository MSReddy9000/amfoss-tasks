# **Project Euler #1 Multiples of 3 and 5**
## **Method of Approach**
This task was pretty straightforward. I had to calculate the sums of the multiples of 3 and 5. Since 3 and 5 have 15 as product, we need to remove the duplicates. As the multiples of 15 will be counted twice, I had to remove the sum once. So, finally it was sum(3) + sum(5) - sum(15) for the final answer. I tried to manually sum the multiples below n but, the result timed out for a few cases. So, I tried to implement a different solution using (n)x(n+1)/2 ,i.e. the sum of n consecutive natural numbers, I found the nearest multiples of 3,5,15 and then, took common 3, 5 and 15 to get a stream of a few consecutive natural numbers. Then, applied (n)x(n+1)/2 and multiplied it with 3,5 and 15 respectively. Finally, added the sums of 3,5 and subtracted the one of 15. It worked. When I went though the discussions, apparently it was the only O(1) solution that can be implemented in Python.
