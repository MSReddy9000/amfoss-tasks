# **Project Euler #3 Largest prime factor**
## **Method of Approach**
Idk about you guys but, this task was definitely the trickiest one for me in all the 5 tasks. The 5th one has about 60 lines of code and 4th 30 lines but, neither of them were tricky at all. It took me solid hours to crack this one in the fastest way I could and yet, I doubt if my solution is actually good. At the time of writing, it's been just a month since I learnt the basics of Python and coding so, please excuse me if the solution is bad. I mean, I knew how crappy the code I wrote was that I had to submit the code in PyPy3 instead of regular Python so that it wouldn't timeout smh. The method of approach is pretty much a bruteforce tactic. I wrote the code to find each divisor of the given number, store all of them in a list and print the largest. The code went haywire when the given number itself was prime, so I made an if-else statement to sort that out. Now, a question comes. What, if the largest divisor is composite?!?!?!?! To fix that, I iterated the loop till the square root of N instead of N.
