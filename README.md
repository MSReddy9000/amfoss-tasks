## QnA
Some questions that might arise in the mind of the reader while going through this repo
### **Why didn't I attempt Task-10?**
So, the basic foundation for all these tasks is built from task-10 right? So, why didn't I attempt it? It could've been EXTREMELY useful to me as I was an absolute noob to coding, right? Yes. And for me, that was the problem. I know that this sounds weird but, I personally felt that attempting CS-50 was probably playing this game in easy mode.
That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I learnt from them bi0s tasks that doing proper research is EXTREMELY important. If I went directly into CS-50, everything I wanted to learn would be right in there! No challenge for me, or something like that. Yeah, I'm a crazy guy lol. I wanted to play on hard mode. So,
I didn't attempt CS-50 at all and did all the groundwork for each task from the very scratch all by myself. YES, there were times when I just wished I did the course to make these tasks easier. But, at the time of writing: "Do I regret not doing the course?" NO, not A BIT.
As I mentioned in introspection, having fun is singularly "THE" most important thing for me when it comes to coding. I thoroughly enjoyed doing every task and learning at the same time. I'm sure that it wouldn't be the case if I had everything laid out in front of me.
I hope you guys excuse me for my thinking. Even you don't, I still learnt a lot by attempting these tasks and hope to carry on the same way throughout the rest of my learning experience.
### **Why didn't I attempt Task-13?**
So, I don't know the first thing about Arduino Circuits or hardware or C++. I figured it would just be easier to learn about "coding" than, "coding AND hardware" so I kept pushing this task down
my list of priorities. If you're reading this, it means that I haven't got it to it "YET" :p
### **How did I even stumble upon PyPy3?!?!?!**
Well..... tbh idk lol. Right when I was starting to solve the problems in Task-3, my code ran just about as fast as a sloth did. So, I asked Google if there was any way to make Python code run faster.
On every page, this "PyPy3" kept popping up. So, I did a bit of research about it and after managing to drag myself through all the technical abracadabra, I managed to piece together a simple sentence: “If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy.” — Guido van Rossum\
So, yeah I experimented with PyPy3 a lot while solving these tasks.
### **Why did I use Python wherever I can, when I could've used C/C++ or something else?**
Yeah, this one is simple. Cuz Python is the only language that I know something about. Yes, I learnt a bit of C and C++ from those bi0s tasks but, at the time of writing I'm more comfortable with coding in Python when compared to C/C++
## **So, who's this MSReddy character?**
