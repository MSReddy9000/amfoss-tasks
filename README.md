## QnA
Some questions that might arise in the mind of the reader while going through this repo
### **Why I did not attempt Task-05?**
lol, here's the thing. I DID attempt Task-05. Though, this task proved to be more of a headache than I had expected. There was minimal documentation about web scraping. All I managed to find were three web pages and a single video that had something useful. So, I copy-pasted a few bits of code here and there. I managed to get some semblance of a working script. I finally managed to get the data printed to the console using a lot of CSS-selectors. But for me, the real challenge was writing all that data to a CSV file. So, I tried writing the data to a .txt, and it DID NOT work. Seems, I was giving it a::vector::Vector something instead of &utf8. As a last resort, I googled regarding writing to .csv files. After looking at the official docs I decided that I was MUCH better off skipping this task.
### **Why I did not attempt Task-10?**
It is not something that I can answer in writing. Maybe, I will tell you about it if we talk :)
### **Why I did not attempt Task-13?**
So, I do not know the first thing about Arduino Circuits or hardware or C++. I figured it would just be easier to learn about coding rather than coding AND hardware so, I kept pushing this task down my list of priorities. If you are reading this, it means that I haven't gotten around to it YET :p
### **How did I even stumble upon PyPy3?!?!?!**
Well, tbh idk lol. Right when I was starting to solve the problems in Task-3, my code ran just about as fast as a sloth did. So, I asked Google if there was any way to make Python code run a bit faster.
On every page, this PyPy3 kept popping up. So, I did a bit of research about it. After finally managing to drag me through all the technical abracadabra, I managed to piece together a simple sentence: “If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy.” — Guido van Rossum\
So, I experimented with PyPy3 a lot while solving these tasks.
### **Why did I use Python wherever I can, when I could have used C/C++ or something else?**
Yeah, this one is simple. Python was the only language that I was comfortable with when I started these tasks. Yes, I learned a bit of C from those bi0s tasks but, when starting on these tasks, I was more comfortable with Python. At the time of writing, I am confident enough that I can code in other languages as well.
## **So, who is this MSReddy character?**
He is a village-born boy who did his schooling in Hyderabad. He has been tinkering with mobiles, refrigerators, hacking into flash games using Cheat Engine, and what-not from his childhood. He got hooked to coding when he learned a tiny bit of QBASIC at his school. He wanted to learn coding for a long time now. But, he did not know where to start or how to start. He came to Amritapuri seeking a better future. He thinks he will accomplish something great someday............ or maybe not but, how will he know without trying first?
